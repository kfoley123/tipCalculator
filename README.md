## Description

The purpose of this app is to show how much each person in a party owes given a specific bill and tip amount. Bill can be split by up to 6 people and the tip can be chosen from 10%, 15%, 20% or a custom amount.

I created this app to practise using the useState hook as well as the classnames package in React.
